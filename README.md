# Join Frontend

This is the frontend part of the Join project, a collaborative task management tool.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Frontend and Backend Projects**
   - Clone this frontend project.
   - Clone the backend project as well (find the backend [here](https://github.com/Kakar21/Join-Backend)).

2. **Setup and Start the Backend**
   - Follow the instructions in the backend project's README (available [here](https://github.com/Kakar21/Join-Backend/blob/main/README.md)) to set up and start the backend server.

3. **Start the Frontend**
   - Open `index.html` and run it with Live Server (e.g., in Visual Studio Code).
   - This will start the frontend, and it should connect to the backend if it's running correctly.

4. **Guest Login Setup**
   - To log in as a guest, click on "Sign up" and create a guest user for guest login.
   - The guest login credentials can be found in `js/login_signup/login.js` at the top of the file in the variable named **guest**.

5. **Set up Backend Endpoint**
   - Make sure to update the `STORAGE_URL` variable in `storage.js` to match your backend's URL endpoint.

### That's It!

You have successfully set up Join with a frontend and backend, running locally on your system. Feel free to make changes and use this project as a base for your own ideas. Enjoy!
